## Description
  
The employee-tracker is an excellent demonstration of MySQL usage. This application from a developer perspective, gave valuable experience for creating a database, schema and seeding files. The most attention was given to creating the Inquirer menu and linking user input to interact with the database, particularly with updating employee information and retrieving specific datasets to populate Inquirer list choices.
